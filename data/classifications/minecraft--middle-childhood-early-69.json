  "summary_guidance": "The most developmentally impactful dimension of Minecraft for this age stage is its Behaviour Shaping scale of human impact, as it encourages creativity and problem-solving. Minecraft's adaptive feedback structure and engagement maximisation intent make it highly engaging for children in the early stages of middle childhood, fostering a sense of achievement and autonomy. However, its persistent data retention and high exposure likelihood necessitate parental guidance and privacy safeguards.",
