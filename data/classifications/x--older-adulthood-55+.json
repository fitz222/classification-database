  "summary_guidance": "The system's utility intent is well-aligned with the needs of users in the Older Adulthood (55+) stage. However, its reactive feedback structure and semi-interpretable nature may pose challenges for some users. The system's moderate exposure likelihood suggests that it is not overly invasive, but users should still be aware of its context-limited data retention practices.",
