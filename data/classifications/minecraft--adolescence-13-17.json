  "summary_guidance": "The most developmentally impactful dimension of Minecraft for adolescents is its Behaviour Shaping scale of human impact, as it encourages creativity and problem-solving. The game's Engagement Maximisation intent and Reactive feedback structure contribute to a high exposure likelihood, with the game's challenges and rewards system designed to keep users engaged. However, the Semi-Interpretable nature of the game's algorithm and its Persistent (user-linked) data exposure and retention may raise privacy concerns.",
